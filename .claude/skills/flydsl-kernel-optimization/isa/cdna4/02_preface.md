# Preface

## About This Document

This document describes the current environment, organization and program state of AMD CDNA4 devices. It details the instruction set and the microcode formats native to this family of processors that are accessible to programmers and compilers.

The document specifies the instructions (including the format of each type of instruction) and the relevant program state (including how the program state interacts with the instructions). Some instruction fields are mutually dependent; not all possible settings for all fields are legal. This document specifies the valid combinations.

The main purposes of this document are to:

1. Specify the language constructs and behavior, including the organization of each type of instruction in both text syntax and binary format.

2. Provide a reference of instruction operation that compiler writers can use to maximize performance of the processor.

## Audience

This document is intended for programmers writing application and system software, including operating systems, compilers, loaders, linkers, device drivers, and system utilities. It assumes that programmers are writing compute-intensive parallel applications (streaming applications) and assumes an understanding of requisite programming practices.

## Organization

This document begins with an overview of the AMD CDNA processors' hardware and programming environment (Chapter 1).

Chapter 2 describes the organization of CDNA programs.

Chapter 3 describes the program state that is maintained.

Chapter 4 describes the program flow.

Chapter 5 describes the scalar ALU operations.

Chapter 6 describes the vector ALU operations.

Chapter 7 describes the vector Matrix ALU operations.

Chapter 8 describes the scalar memory operations.

Chapter 9 describes the vector memory operations.

Chapter 10 provides information about the flat memory instructions.

Chapter 11 describes the data share operations.

Chapter 12 describes instruction details, first by the microcode format to which they belong, then in alphabetic order.

Finally, Chapter 13 provides a detailed specification of each microcode format.
